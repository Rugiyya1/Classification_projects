# Classification_projects

This repository inlcudes small classification projects

1. Ham/Spam Classifier
   This model classifies youtube comments as ham (0) or spam (1). 

2. Coin detector
   This project determines circular coins and detects their values based on radius and brightness info.
   Note that this code is only for circular coins determination. In future, it will be updated for non-circular object detection.
